2. plotting of fuzzy set in guassian MF
3. plotting of fuzzy set in traingular MF
4. plotting of fuzzy set in trapezoidal MF
## WEEK 02
1. any user defined continnuous MF
2. plot perferable number of children in the fuzzy
3. plot preferable cities to live in
## WEEK 03
1. To carry out intersection union and complement operations on discrete fuzzy set and plot
2. To carry out intersection union and complement operations on continuous fuzzy set and plot
## WEEK 04
1. combine the 1st mf and 2nd mf and show intersections
2. Demorgans law
3. verification of fuzzy set identities
## WEEK 05
1. matrix multiplication in r
2. max-min composition
3. max-product composition
4. FUZZY IF THEN RULES
## WEEK 06
1. Find De-fuzzified value for single trapezoidal MF
2. Find De-fuzzified value for two trapezoidal MF using union and intersection
## WEEK 07
1. Implementation of a very simplistic underwriting rating 
system by defining linguistic variables about a potential ensure. 
fuzzy rule will be defined based on those linguistic variable, fuzzy
inference will be performed and finally it is defuzzified to an 
underwritting rating.
## WEEK 08
1.Implement a FIS for weather forecasting give 3 linguistic variable(temperature,
humidity, precipitation)
## WEEK 09
1.  Design a neural network to classify the application for 
a testimonal  job placement  (placed = 5, not place = 0)
2. Design a NN to obtain sqrt of input numbers
